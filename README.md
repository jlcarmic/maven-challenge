# Maven Challenge

## The Challenge
Write a program which delivers a working network server which handles traffic over HTTP and receives JSON input and output. The server will need to maintain simple state and youâ€™ll need to make design decisions based on your understanding of the problem.

## Routes Available

### GET http://localhost:1337/

This route will return a full list of all numbers seen with the number of times they have been seen.

#### Expected Response
```JSON
[
  {
    "number": 1,
    "times": 4,
  },
  {
    "number": 2,
    "times": 1
  }
]
```

### POST http://localhost:1337/

This route accepts a number. If the number has not been seen it is added to the list of numbers. If the number has previously been seen, its times attribute is incremented by 1.

#### Expected Headers

#### Expected Body
```JSON
{
  "number": 1
}
```

#### Expected Response
```JSON
{
  "number": 1,
  "times": 1
}
```

### PUT http://localhost:1337/

This route expects a number and an increment_value greater than 1. If the number has been previously seen, the times attribute of that number will be incremented by the increment_value provided.

#### Expected Headers
Content-Type: application/json

#### Expected Body
```JSON
{
  "number": 1,
  "increment_value": 3
}
```

#### Expected Response
```JSON
